# Sentiment_Classifier_Pipeline
I am using the BERT Model for building this pipeline
I used Transfer Learning I took the Transformer model Which is Pre-trained model the I fine tune it on my custome dataset.
So that it performs the Sentiment classification better way

BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a state-of-the-art language model developed by researchers at Google AI Language in 2018. It has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) by enabling machines to understand the context of words in a sentence more effectively than previous models.
